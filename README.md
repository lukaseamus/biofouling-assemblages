# biofouling-assemblages
Ecological analyses of biofouling assemblages on settlement tiles.


This repository contains two .csv files and one .R file. The .csv files 
contain the raw (rawtiles.csv) and processed (tiles.csv) data. The .R file
contains all analytical and data visualisation procedures.

Analyses include multi-way ANOVA, Student's t.test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
PERMANOVA, SIMPER, SIMPROF and PCO. Visualisations are mostly plotted with ggplot2 
and include histograms, scatterplots, barplots, boxplots, dendrograms and nMDS plots.
